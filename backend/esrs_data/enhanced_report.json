In our own workforce, this includes full-time employees, self-employed individuals, and workers provided by third-party organizations, all of whom are monitored for both potential risks—such as exposure to unsafe conditions—and opportunities for upskilling and career development. Similarly, in our value chain, workers in extraction, manufacturing, logistics, and distribution are evaluated for adverse impacts, including those related to forced or child labor, as well as for positive outcomes like improved working conditions through capacity-building initiatives. Furthermore, affected communities—whether those living near our operational sites or those connected to our supply network—are assessed for socio-economic and environmental impacts, while consumers and end-users are considered in terms of product safety, information accessibility, and overall impact on quality of life. This comprehensive mapping informs our strategy to mitigate risks and enhance positive impacts throughout our entire value chain.",

In addition, the undertaking shall provide the following information:\n(a) a brief description of the types of employees and non-employees in its own workforce subject to material impacts by its operations, and specify whether they are employees, self- employed people, or people provided by third party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities;\n(b) in the case of material negative impacts, whether they are either (i) widespread or systemic in contexts where the undertaking operates (for example, child labour or forced labour or compulsory labour in specific countries or regions outside the EU), or (ii) related to individual incidents (for example, an industrial accident or an oil spill);\n(c) in the case of material positive impacts, a brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts, the types of employees and non-employees in its own workforce that are positively affected or could be positively affected; the undertaking may also disclose whether the positive impacts occur in specific countries or regions;\n(d) any material risks and opportunities for the undertaking arising from impacts and dependencies on its own workforce;\n(e) any material impacts on its own workforce that may arise from transition plans for reducing negative impacts on the environment and achieving greener and climate- neutral operations, including information on the impacts on own workforce caused by the undertaking’s plans and actions to reduce carbon emissions in line with international agreements. Impacts, risks and opportunities include restructuring and employment loss as well as opportunities arising from job creation and reskilling or upskilling;\n(f) operations at significant risk of incidents of forced labour or compulsory labour either in terms of:\ni. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant); or\nii. countries or geographic areas with operations considered at risk;\n(g) operations at significant risk of incidents of child labour either in terms of:\ni. type of operation (such as manufacturing plant); or\nii. countries or geographic areas with operations considered at risk.",
